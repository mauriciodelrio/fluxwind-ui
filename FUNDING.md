# 💖 Funding & Sponsorship

## Our Commitment

**Fluxwind UI is and will always be:**

- ✅ **100% free** for everyone
- ✅ **MIT licensed** with no restrictions
- ✅ **Open source** with transparent development
- ✅ **No paid tiers** or exclusive features
- ✅ **No enterprise-only components**
- ✅ **Fully accessible** to individuals and companies alike

---

## 🎯 Funding Philosophy

Fluxwind UI follows a unique funding model called **"Sponsored Features, Public Access"**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Everything remains FREE and MIT licensed forever   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Funding comes from:
├─ 💝 Voluntary donations (individuals)
└─ 🏢 Sponsored feature development (companies)
    ├─ Company pays for specific features
    ├─ Features are developed professionally
    └─ Features are released publicly (MIT) for all
```

**Key Principle:** When a company sponsors a feature, they're not buying exclusivity—they're accelerating public development. The entire community benefits.

## 💝 Individual Support

If you're an individual developer or small team using Fluxwind UI and want to show support:

### Option 1: GitHub Sponsors (Monthly)

[Become a GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mauriciodelrio)

Monthly sponsorship helps with:

- 🔧 Ongoing maintenance
- 🐛 Bug fixes
- 📚 Documentation improvements
- 🆕 Feature development
- 💬 Community support

**Suggested tiers:**

- $2/month - Coffee tier ☕
- $5/month - Supporter tier 🌟
- $10/month - Enthusiast tier 💎

**Note:** All tiers get the same features (everything). Support tiers are purely voluntary ways to contribute.

### Option 2: Buy Me a Coffee (One-time)

Perfect for one-time support when:

- You just discovered the library and love it

### Sponsored Feature Development

**For companies needing specific features:**

If your company needs particular components or features that aren't in the roadmap, you can commission their development:

#### How It Works

1. **Contact & Discussion**
   - Email: mauriciodelr@gmail.com
   - Discuss your needs and requirements
   - Evaluate feasibility and alignment with library goals

2. **Proposal & Quote**
   - I provide detailed specification
   - Development timeline estimate
   - Fair pricing based on complexity
   - Contract terms and deliverables

3. **Development**
   - Professional development with tests
   - Regular progress updates
   - Review and feedback cycles
   - Quality assurance

4. **Public Release**
   - Features merged to main branch
   - Released under MIT license
   - Available to entire community
   - Your company credited as sponsor
   - Documentation and examples included

#### Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is based on:

- **Complexity** - Lines of code, edge cases, testing needs
- **Timeline** - Urgency and scheduling constraints
- **Scope** - Single component vs. feature system
- **Quality bar** - Must meet library standards

**What's included:**

- ✅ Full TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (95%+)
- ✅ Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Storybook examples
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Integration with existing systems

#### Requirements for Sponsorship

To maintain library quality and consistency, sponsored features must:

- ✅ Meet accessibility standards (WCAG AA minimum)
- ✅ Include comprehensive tests (95%+ coverage)
- ✅ Follow existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Include proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Have clear documentation
- ✅ Be generally useful (not company-specific hacks)

**I reserve the right to decline sponsorships that:**

- ❌ Would compromise library quality
- ❌ Introduce breaking changes unnecessarily
- ❌ Add excessive dependencies
- ❌ Violate accessibility principles
- ❌ Create maintenance burden

## ❓ FAQ

### Why not charge for the library?

**Because open source works best when it's truly open.** Making everything free:

- Enables wider adoption
- Allows unlimited experimentation
- Removes barriers for students and small teams
- Encourages contributions
- Builds stronger community

### What if no one donates?

**The library continues as a passion project.** While donations help accelerate development, Fluxwind UI will continue to be maintained and improved regardless. Your support makes it _faster_, not _possible_.

### Can I use this commercially without paying?

**Absolutely!** MIT license explicitly allows commercial use without any payment. Sponsorship is completely optional and voluntary.

### What about enterprise support?

**Not offered.** I don't have capacity for ongoing support contracts. However:

- 🐛 Bug reports are addressed for everyone
- 📚 Comprehensive documentation
- 🏢 Sponsored features include proper docs

### Can features be sponsored anonymously?

**Yes!** If you prefer anonymity:

- We won't list your company publicly
- Contribution credits can be generic ("Anonymous Sponsor")
- Features still released publicly under MIT

Contact me directly to discuss.

### How long does feature sponsorship take?

I don't have fixed timelines. Let's talk first!
