              Note: GitHub Copilot for Pull Requests is currently in beta and requires enabling in your repository settings.
              
              **Alternative**: Use GitHub's native code review features with Copilot enabled in your IDE for inline suggestions.
              
              To enable Copilot for PRs:
              1. Go to repository Settings → Code security and analysis
              2. Enable "GitHub Copilot" features
              3. Or use the GitHub Copilot CLI: \`gh copilot review\`
              
              For now, you can use:
              - \`/describe\` - PR description (requires OpenAI credits)
              - \`/review\` - Code review (requires OpenAI credits)
              - Manual review with Copilot suggestions in your IDE`
            });
